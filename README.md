The ultimate objective of every industrial plant or vital utility plant is to increase output quantity and quality while keeping production costs as low as feasible. To do this, plants must be kept in peak operating conditions in order for the system's throughput to be maximized. The system must be properly maintained in order to remain completely functional. The plant's efficiency is maintained by a variety of maintenance measures. Maintenance has an impact on the cost of items produced in any sector. To avoid breakdowns, maintenance plans should be developed so that maintenance chores are completed at the appropriate times. Unnecessary maintenance chores raise maintenance expenses while also lengthening the time it takes to do them. Through this paper, the aim is to build an MES system that leverages the advantages of technologies such as Digital Twins, Machine Learning, Industrial internet of things, and Predictive Maintenance (PdM) together with Industry 4.0 principles. The goal is to optimize plant operation, i.e. reducing system downtime, which would result in lower production costs
